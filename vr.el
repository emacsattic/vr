;; Revision 1.9  2001/11/17 01:22:03  patrik
;; Defined deferred-function as a variable, so you don't have to worry
;; about that if you don't load pbvElse.  It also changed the list of
;; nonlocal exit commands to a constant.
;;
;; Revision 1.8  2001/11/08 08:23:57  patrik
;; Fixed a little bug concerning the positioning of point in
;; make-changes.  Before we would only reposition it manually if the user
;; made a selection or repositioning of point.  This messed up the
;; behavior of NaturallySpeaking when point was already at the beginning
;; of a word.  In this case, NaturallySpeaking will insert a space, but
;; wants point to be at the end of the first word, not that the beginning
;; of the second which is where it will be after just running the self
;; insertion.  Solved this by making a "relative" repositioning, meaning
;; that point is put where NaturallySpeaking wanted it to be relative to
;; the end of the insertion string.  This solves the spacing behavior
;; above (which also would make NaturallySpeaking refuse to scratch,
;; since point had been moved), and even works with the deferred-function
;; movement commands, since it is relative to where point ends up being.
;;
;; Revision 1.7  2001/11/08 07:03:08  patrik
;; When quitting a remote Emacs, it would sometimes close the window
;; before VR.EXE had had time to process the shutdown, so I added a delay
;; in the kill-Emacs hook, after turning VR mode off.  Seems to work.
;;
;; Revision 1.6  2001/09/25 01:44:38  patrik
;; Worked around the exit-minibuffer lockup by checking if the command
;; about to be executed is one of the commands that never exits.  If so,
;; it uses the deferred-function mechanism instead.  The commands for
;; which this is done are kept in the variable vr-nonlocal-exit-commands.
;;
;; It seems to work well.  You cannot, of course, continue dictating
;; after the New-Line in the minibuffer, but then doing so seems a little
;; excessive as well...
;;
;; Revision 1.5  2001/09/10 23:35:10  patrik
;; Smoothed out a number of rough edges concerning the continuous
;; commands.  Most of the changes are in pbvElse, but there were a number
;; of problems with the deferred-function variables not being cleared
;; properly.  It still seems that sometimes expand-placeholder, which
;; should be executed in make-changes, does not get run.  Instead, it
;; will be run the next time you enter make-changes.  I have no idea why
;; this happens.
;;
;; Also fixed some problems with the execute-function function, stupid
;; Lisp stuff like whether the command sequence is a list or a vector,
;; and so on.
;;
;; Also added the running of pre-command-hook and post-command-hook for
;; our "simulated" keyboard input.  I hope that this would have cured the
;; fact that macro definitions don't recognize the VR mode keystrokes,
;; but it didn't.  I don't know how macros read keystrokes when they're
;; being defined.
;;
;; Revision 1.4  2001/09/01 10:56:47  patrik
;; Changed the command processing so that all commands except those
;; specified as vectors of keystrokes are executed directly.  The
;; advantage of doing this is that commands executed as keystrokes change
;; the active buffer to the minibuffer, so the changes to the buffer were
;; not communicated properly.  This was the case for yank, for example.
;;
;; Revision 1.3  2001/09/01 08:46:53  patrik
;; Fixed several problems with the abbreviation mode and ELSE.  The
;; routine handle-abbrev-expansion used to reinsert the placeholder text
;; that ELSE would remove when you type into the placeholder.  It would
;; then also run the commands and avoid the expansion by an on purpose
;; error.  This messed up VR mode since the error would stop processing
;; of the changes.  Made a very similar routine called
;; fix-else-abbrev-expansion, which would reinsert the placeholder text
;; but not call the command.  It's now called just before the command is
;; executed in vr-report-change.
;;
;; Also made a temporary fix for the fact that expand-placeholder is not
;; a command that returns quickly, but requires user input.  Since it is
;; called before make-changes sends tick and change counts, vr.exe would
;; timeout.  The fix checks if the command it is about to execute is
;; expand-placeholder, and if it is report-changes simply doesn't do
;; anything.  Instead, make-changes, after sending tick and change
;; counts, checks if deferred-deferred-function is set, and in that case
;; executes the command.  Of course this doesn't work if
;; expand-placeholder is not the last command in the utterance, but on
;; the other hand that doesn't make sense, because expand-placeholder
;; requires input, so it should be the last.
;;
;; It still isn't perfect, because ELSE uses before-change-functions to
;; delete the placeholder, which means that VR mode will get out of
;; sync.  I can't think of a simple way of taking care of this, when the
;; Emacs buffer changes before any characters have been entered, and
;; vr.exe thinks that all the characters have already been typed, it's
;; not straightforward to sort that out.
